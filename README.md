### Hi, I’m Divyajeet Singh!

I'm a student at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, pursuing B. Tech. in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I’m interested in Machine Learning, Python, and especially programming that requires Math, and requires me to study Math XD. I'm a nerd about science and math, and it shows in my projects. I’m well-versed in Python and C, and am currently learning C++ and Java. [Click here to reach out to me!](https://linktr.ee/divyajeettt)
