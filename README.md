Hi, I’m Divyajeet Singh. I'm a student at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, more commonly known as IIIT-D. I’m interested in Machine Learning, Python, and especially programming that requires Math, and requires me to study Math XD. YES I'm a Math Nerd. I’m well-versed in Python, and am currently learning C++ and Java. You can reach me through either of my e-mail IDs:
